# lists-and-iterations

Purr provides a toolkit for functional programming when working with lists in R. Examples here highlight the application of map functions to apply commands to all elements in lists. Further work is done extracting specific values from lists.
Further work is done with iterations on basic mathmatic equations and statistical tests to highlight the ability to create loops that can work with multiple input pairings while also being able to extract specific aspects of tests from the loop itself.
